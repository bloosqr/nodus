# Nodus Scriptor verification

These captures come from the compiled application running with isolated, synthetic test fixtures. They do not contain the maintainer’s preview vault or saved personal prompts.

- [Catalogue](catalog-list.png): list view, nested collections, search, tags, and the Tools shortcut.
- [Insertion before the menu fixes](insert-before.png) and [current searchable insertion](insert-search.png): the visible search field, compact menu, and icon-only Context/Focus controls.
- [Dark menu at its last item](insert-dark-last-item.png): footer and final action remain fully visible.
- [Academic delivery](academic-delivery.png): preflight warnings and an actual generated manuscript preview. This earlier academic audit capture predates the final icon-only header change.

## Storage, compatibility, and delivery

BlockNote 0.55.0 native JSON is stored alongside separate schema/revision metadata. Additive migrations 198 and 199 extend Study/Teaching documents, versions, and comment anchors. Notes keep the native document in their page’s Yjs state; web artifacts retain owner isolation, expected revisions, native snapshots, and Markdown projections. Opening a legacy document converts it in memory without writing it until an edit occurs. Unknown blocks remain recoverable compatibility blocks.

Academic references, CSL citation formatting, footnotes/endnotes, cross-references, evidence marks, manuscript chapters, preflight, and DOCX/PDF/LaTeX exports are documented in [the academic workflow report](../../scriptor-academic-workflow-2026-10-02.md). Export snapshots do not alter the original documents. Resource/preflight limitations and manual evidence checks are described there.

## Reproduction

```sh
npm run lint
npm run typecheck
npm run build
npm run build:server-web
npm run licenses:verify
node --test scripts/test-blocknote-storage.mjs scripts/test-academic-scriptor.mjs scripts/test-editor-references.mjs scripts/test-scriptor-navigation.mjs
node --test server/test/blockNoteArtifacts.test.mjs server/test/academicExport.test.mjs server/test/userProfilePreferences.integration.test.mjs
node --test scripts/test-i18n-coverage.mjs scripts/test-i18n-no-duplicate-keys.mjs scripts/test-server-generated.mjs
node scripts/e2e-editorial-workspace.mjs
node scripts/e2e-editorial-server-web.mjs
node scripts/e2e-academic-scriptor.mjs
node scripts/e2e-academic-server-web.mjs
node scripts/e2e-scriptor-actions.mjs
node scripts/e2e-scriptor-block-controls.mjs
node scripts/e2e-scriptor-insert.mjs --desktop --skip-stress
node scripts/e2e-scriptor-insert.mjs --web

npm run test:e2e
```

The completed insertion campaigns exercised all 30 options and their native JSON/academic metadata after saving and reopening: 52 desktop checks, 51 web checks, and one independent performance campaign. A follow-up web search campaign passed 15 checks. The post-main-integration desktop search/layout campaign passed 16 checks. Native block controls passed 224 geometry/behavior checks, with a maximum first-line alignment deviation of 0.5 px.

Eight openings with 300 paragraphs, 100 citations, and context open produced the first visible menu frame in 35.3–41.3 ms after the click. Maximum observed event-loop intervals were 63.8 ms in Electron’s main process and 64.3 ms in the renderer; the longest renderer task was 59 ms. Opening/filtering/closing without choosing preserved the native document and revision. These measurements describe the tested machine and fixture.

The final visual campaign covered desktop and web, light/dark themes, list/cards, editor, context, navigator, focus, academic dialogs, and export previews at 1280×800, 1440×900, and 1920×1080, with additional narrow-window menu checks. The audited galleries and detailed reports remain reproducible through the scripts; generated runtime output and profiles are intentionally excluded from Git.

The AI streaming regression controls only the provider transport; real UI, selections, persistence, cancellation, and one-step undo are exercised without sending test content to an external AI provider. Voice panels were visually audited at rest; the general smoke suite uses a fake microphone for capture/privacy checks. This work does not provide external peer review, automated grading, or remote-media fetching beyond existing policies.

## Pull-request integration checks

After merging current main, 133 focused checks and 50 translation/Focus/security checks passed. The final general `npm run test:e2e` completed successfully through the real Electron app, including Scriptor/Study writing, prompts, selection, native persistence, voice, Primary Sources, Worldbuilding, and Genealogy; it reported no renderer page errors and schema v199. Lint, both typechecks, Desktop/Server Web builds, and license verification also passed locally. The complete repository test inventory remains a separate CI requirement.

Follow-up fixes ensure Escape closes the foreground synonyms panel before the native formatting popover handles it, and the production Server image includes the portable sidebar migration dependency. The Server image health check and cross-repository capability verification passed on Linux, macOS, and Windows on the preceding code commit.

## Compact creation and tab clipping follow-up

The catalogue creation trigger is now a 32 px icon-only plus with a translated accessible name, retaining the Note, Idea, Manuscript, and Collection menu. Its menu remains anchored below the trigger. Scriptor tab tracks reserve 4 px above and below their 28 px tabs, so borders and shadows are fully visible without changing the header height or application sidebar.

Real Desktop and Server Web checks passed in light/dark themes at 1280×800, 1440×900, and 1920×1080 (12 combinations), covering the catalogue and editor, multiple open tabs, menu position/options, and keyboard activation. Desktop also verifies one application tooltip; Server Web retains its existing native title-tooltip behavior. Typechecks, targeted lint, and both renderer builds passed. [Creation menu](create-menu.png) and [editor tabs](editor-tabs.png) show isolated synthetic fixtures.

## CI compatibility follow-up

Migration 198 now adds only missing columns, matching the existing branch-renumbering recovery convention. The storage regression replays migrations 198–199 against a partially upgraded database and compares native documents, versions, revisions and comment anchors before and after, while checking that the absent column is restored.

Scriptor validation/export errors now use the shared runtime error catalogue. Translation tests cover all eight non-Spanish languages checked by CI, preserve revision/projection conflict codes through IPC, and retain the unsupported formula element in export errors. Formula toolbar metadata uses the existing sigma icon. Navigation tests reflect Scriptor’s move into Tools while preserving each dedicated vault’s domain routes; MCP checks read the canonical manuscript note and verify a subsequent Markdown update through the tool API. Generic BlockNote presence waits select the first matching editor, avoiding strict-selector ambiguity.

All 92 checks in the focused CI regression run passed under Node 22.23.2, including the 17 previously failing test files and native storage replay. Full repository coverage is also required by the PR’s CI run.

The complete local inventory subsequently finished all 824 files (4,599 checks, two documented skips). Its only additional failure was stale generated sitemap dates after dependency metadata changed; regenerating the sitemap and rerunning its three checks passed. Every test file now has a passing result. The real-app general smoke also passed again with no renderer page errors and schema v199.
