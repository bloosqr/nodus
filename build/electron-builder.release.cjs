//
// Two things about `pkg.build` that are easy to get wrong, and that this file is
// the only sensible place to write down, because package.json is JSON and cannot
// hold a comment:
//
//  1. `artifactName` is the literal `Nodus-`, NOT `${productName}`. The installer
//     filenames are a public contract: the site's download buttons, the README
//     and every electron-updater manifest resolve
//     releases/latest/download/Nodus-<os>-<arch>.<ext>, so an install from a year
//     ago updates through them. Renaming the product to "Nodus Research" once
//     went through that template and renamed every artifact, which failed the
//     v4.2.4 upload on all three platforms. The displayed name may change freely;
//     these filenames may not. AppImage overrides the template to omit Linux;
//     finalize-linux-appimage.mjs retains the old name as an identical alias.
//     Held by scripts/test-release-artifact-names.mjs.
//
//  2. electron-builder validates this object against a STRICT schema that rejects
//     unknown properties outright, so `pkg.build` cannot carry a documentation
//     key either — a `_comment` there aborts every packaging run with "Invalid
//     configuration object". That is why this note lives here. Held by
//     scripts/test-electron-builder-config.mjs, which validates against
//     app-builder-lib's own scheme.json rather than waiting for a release.
