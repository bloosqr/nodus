The two live figures on the Support Nodus page: how many people have contributed
and how many issues and proposals the project has collected. Both are read from
the GitHub API, both fall back to what the visitor already has, and neither can
leave a card empty or wrong: an unknown number is shown as unknown, never as 0.
