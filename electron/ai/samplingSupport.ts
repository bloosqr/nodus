/**
 * Models whose provider answered a 400 naming `temperature` as deprecated or unsupported.
 *
 * A provider can retire a sampling knob between two calls — that is how DeepSeek's
 * unversioned ids arrived, and OpenAI's o-series did the same — so each transport learns the
 * model once and stops sending the field. Session-scoped on purpose: a restart costs one
 * failed request per model, and a model's sampling contract is not worth persisting.
 *
 * Shared by `aiClient` (the generic OpenAI-compatible transport) and `openCodeGoCompletion`
 * (OpenCode Go speaks its own HTTP), so a model learned on one route does not have to fail
 * again on the other.
